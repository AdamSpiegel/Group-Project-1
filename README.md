## <u>Recipe and Cocktail Generator - Group Project 1</u>

## <u>Project Goals</u>

* As a user, I want to be able to select the type of alcohol I prefer,
so that I can have a cocktail recipe generate for me.

* As a user, I want to have a recipe generate for me, based upon the ingriedients the user has
so that I can have a recipe automatically generate for me.

* As a user, I want to see the nutritional value of the recipes that are generated for me,
so that I can mantain a healthy lifestyle and keep track of my caloric intake.

* As a user, I want to have a my recipes and cocktail recipes save to my local computer,
so that I can have them saved for future use.

## <u>Project Description</u>

* Collectively as a group, our goal with this project was to create a recipe and cocktail generator which made it easy for the consumer to select a randomized cocktail and dinner recipe, based off of a couple initial ingredients.

* The main user issue we were trying to reslove (weather that be for parents, students, employees with long hours during the week), was to create a simple and fast solution as to the common nightly questions "What do I want for dinner and to drink?".  We are all on a busy schedule and we were trying to create a simple solution for the user.

* As a team, we wanted to create a user friendly experience, as this as an application designed to reduce the common stress we all incur from being rushed around and not having enough time to focus on a proper meal.

## <u>Action Items</u> 

    1) Initially, our team developed a wire frame for the outline of our application through the draw.io app.  We created a general outline to create the styling and design of the web page we were looking to build.
    2) Next, we built out our basic HTML page and added in a CSS, JavaScript and gitignore files.  We designed the very basics of our HTML page to reflect the "Cocktail and Recipe Generator" and build a starting structure.
    3) In place of Bootstrap, we chose to work with Materialize as an alternate CSS styling template.  We utilized Materialize for our Navbar and Modals predominatley in this project, along with the rows and coloums to display our search content.
    4) Also included for this project was Google Fonts, a Jquery library (although Vanilla JS was utilized mostly), and a custom CSS styling sheet as well.
    5) Next, we split up responsibilites in this project.  Our JavaScript was built out over the course of the week and a half collectively among our team, after the HTML was developed.  This was a long process as our JS had to include several Event Listeners and Functions to get our lists to populate correctly.
    6) Also included in the JS are API calls.  These come from "TheCocktailDB.com" and "TheMealDB.com" both of which were public APIs.  These are what are used in the JS to actually retrieve our drink/food ingredient options, along with the the drink/food recipes themselves.
    7) While the JS was being developed, after the main structure of our HTML was built, we began styling with Materialze and our CSS docs.  This is an ongoing process as well up until presentation day, but we styled this to look as professional as possible.  Re-branding may be necessary down the line, but the layout of the page looks appropriate.
    8) Finally, among many group collabortation days, we have developed a list of Ice Box Items and other areas which will need further development on this project.  Overall though, we were able to obtain the API calls and outcomes which we were pushing for. 

## <u>Ice Box Ideas and Troubleshooting</u> 
    1) Future development ideas include:
        - Using an API call to generate images of the actual cocktail and meal recipes selected by the user.
        - Displaying the nutritonal value of the options selected by the user (drink or food).
        - Giving the user the ability to write and post reviews on a specific cocktail or meal.
        - Proper company branding
    
    2) Troubleshooting areas include:
        - Creating only one "Search Button" to utilize both API calls. General style upgrades to the page.
        - Creating a user reset button, so the page does not have to be refreshed manually by the user after searching.
        - Updating media queries appropriatley, to create a better mobile experience.
